# Machine Learning Dev Mac Setup
Quick way to consistently set up a new mac with my personal dev preferences for Machine Learning.

# Preliminaries
1. Unbox and admire your shiny new hardware
2. Launch app store and download all updates. I assume you are running OSX version macOS High Sierra or later.

# Let's Go
Launch Terminal and type:

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tjaffri/ml-dev-mac-setup/master/setup.sh)
```

See comments in ``setup.sh`` for more information on what it is doing. Set up is not completely unattended and will break occasionally to ask for credentials etc.

Please enjoy responsibly.
